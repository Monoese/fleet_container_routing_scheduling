This goal of this project is to solve large-scale integrated routing and scheduling problems for fleet and containers with stochastic demand in maritime container transport. A planning algorithm that optimizes routing and scheduling decisions in a recursive manner is proposed. A simulation script is developed to create various instances and simulate fleet-container operations optimized by this algorithm over a planning horizon.

You will need a Python environment with following packages to run the simulation script:
1. dijkstra
2. mip
3. numpy 
4. sklearn
